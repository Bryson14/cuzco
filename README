README

The purpose of this project is to learn about data analysis, creating API and servers.
These are very useful skills and are very relevant for the labor force. 

API
For this project, we gathered data from alpaca, a financial institution that requires the same info as a bank 
or any other financial institution. Using the correct documentation, it sends financial data such as stocks, 
market values, company accounting statistics. It is also able to take calls that will buy and sell stocks, options,
and other market related securities.

SERVER
This is our data frame for our pull and get requests to and from the alpaca API.
It is from this server that our data is analyzed and understood. Django was usedâ€¦

ALGO
The whole S&P 500 is first scanned and compared for correlation, results in 127765 correlation comparisons.
As this is a very costly function, correlation is relatively fast. If the correlation between any two securities is
greater than .80, then the identified pair further analyzed by cointegration test and an augmented dicky fuller test.
If the result of this deeper test is less than .02, then the pair is returned as a pair capable to implementing a
profitable pairs trading strategy. This analysis is run every month in case of stocks falling out of correlation with others.
